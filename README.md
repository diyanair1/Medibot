# MediBot - Autonomous First Aid Ambulance ⛑️

MediBot is a first-aid ambulance robot designed to navigate through a maze, simulating real road conditions, and deliver first-aid. The project involves building a robot that can detect walls, respond to traffic lights, mimic emergency vehicle behavior, such as detecting sirens and activating emergency lights to bypass red lights, and deliver first aid. The robot is designed using the Lego EV3 platform and programmed with RobotC.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot detects and avoids walls and obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.
- **Traffic Light Interaction**: The robot responds to traffic lights, stopping for red and slowing for yellow.
- **Emergency Response**: MediBot detects sirens and activates emergency lights to bypass red lights, simulating ambulance behavior.
- **Navigation**: Uses ultrasonic, color, sound, and gyro sensors for navigation and precise movement.
- **First Aid Delivery**: MediBot is equipped with an arm designed to deliver first aid supplies.
